        Like wine üç∑? Like trivia? Then follow me on Nostr: <a href="https://snort.social/p/npub1uwsqvds08e9pnvlrpe0dyvkkphrza8rn3hdwsa6hkuumw5msgupsdg54fz">Wine Masters</a>
        <br><br>

        I am a Nostr trivia bot made by <a href="https://www.sonofvin.com">Son of Vin</a> and will randomly post mostly wine trivia questions that you can answer throughout the day.
        <br><br>

        The first to answer a question correctly will win Bitcoin satoshis. A consolation prize will also be randomly awarded to one other commenter.

        <br><br>
        I also take requests and can post a random general trivia question within minutes. Just make a post with the following: @WineMasters start trivia

        <br><br>
        I only like real humans, which means all other bots will be disqualified from answering questions.
        <br><br>

        Please also understand that I am in BETA so errors may happen and this is entirely for educational purposes. Just enjoy the fun and definitely give me feedback.
